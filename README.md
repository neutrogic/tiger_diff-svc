## About

This is all the information about Tiger's Diff-SVC model in one spot. I'll be updating the information as I update the model.

| Version | Sample Rate | Data | Steps Trained | Pretrained Used |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| v1 | 22050Hz | 30 minutes | 55,000 | Yes |

### v1
 
There's about 30 minutes of data in English and Japanese. This data wasn't intended for Diff-SVC, but is perfectly fine for it. There are plans to add more languages, as well as document more closely how much data of each language there is.
